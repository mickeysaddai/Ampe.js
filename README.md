# Ampe.js

Ampe.js simulates the real life African game - [AMPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZPeon377mM). 


## Game Rules

Two teams of equal number of players lined up against each other. One team will be designated with the name “matched” while the other “unmatched”. Each team will be able to choose from two colors. At the onset of the game, the starting players(leaders) will show their chosen colors at the same time.  If the colors match, the matching team wins a point, otherwise the unmatching team wins a point. Whoever wins the point then checks their next color pick against that of the next opponent in line. After a player gets to the last player of the opponent’s team, they also eliminate the last player to reduce the players of the opponent. The winner of the game is declared once an opponent's players are completely eliminated.
